# FlowWallVFX
Unity's VFX Graph

Wall vfx tests. 
I wanted to use flowmaps to deform the UVs of the textures I use to scale the particles.
There are 2 examples of this effect in the project (GlitchKino and GlitchKinoInputs) ; one is animated along with Keijiro's Kino glitch post processing stack ( https://github.com/keijiro/Kino ), the other uses keyboard inputs to affect the parameters of the vfx.

I use some textures from Luos's texture pack available for free.

Unity version : 2020.1.0a11
