# FlowWallVFX
Unity's VFX Graph

Wall vfx tests. 
I wanted to use flowmaps to deform the UVs of the textures I use to scale the particles.
There are 3 examples of this effect in the project (FlowWall_Animated, FlowWall_BindedKeys, FlowWall+Depth) ; one is animated along with Keijiro's Kino glitch post processing stack ( https://github.com/keijiro/Kino ), the others uses keyboard inputs to affect the parameters of the vfx.

I use some textures from Luos's texture pack available for free and some animations from Mixamo.

Unity version : 2020.1.0a11
